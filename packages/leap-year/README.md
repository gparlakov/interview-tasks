# Leap year

[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/leap-year-64xic)

Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

```on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
 on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
    except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
```

```
According to these rules, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years,
while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, and 2500 are not leap years.
```
